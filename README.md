# MAAC_3607_Final

# Interacting through the command line

You need Github's Large File Storage (lfs) to work with this repo. It allows us to upload blend files which are normally too large.

If you are working on this repo through the command line, you need lfs installed in your local repository. Everything works the same, lfs does not impact the way you use Git, it only modifies the back-end.

Follow this tutorial to download and install it.

** If you are uploading files through the website, you do not need to worry about any of this **
